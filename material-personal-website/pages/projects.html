                    <h2>Cisco</h2>
                    <p>I interned at Cisco as a Software Engineer in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. I worked in Legal and Compliance IT and created a proof of concept (POC) for an internal tool to digitalize the creation of legal documents and digitally manage existing legal documents. For the POC, I implemented a template management system to select the correct form from a series of questions and have the user fill out the dynamic form. I built in form validations to ensure legal compliance and created dynamic input fields like dynamic tables. Once a user fills out the form, then the contents of that form are inserted into a PDF of the legal document. The legal document can then be sent for e-signature and approval. It can be tracked throughout these stages from draft to pending approval to approved in the tool and previous legal documentation can be easily duplicated and reused for new contracts. </p>

                    <p> The current process of filling out legal documentation includes downloading a PDF, filling it out in Word and submitting online for approval. This is a tedious process when employees have to fill out multiple documents multiple times a year. It also allows for legal compliance issues and is hard to internally monitor.</p>

                    <p>A friend and I built a website for Duke students to buy and sell books. Previously, students were using a Facebook group to buy and sell books among students, which was cumbersome and inefficient. My friend and I decided to build a book exchange to make this transaction among students easier. A few features we included are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using Google Book API to get book information like ISBN, authors, cover picture, etc by simply typing in the title</li>
                        <li>Preloaded Duke classes so people can easily fill in the course information for a book</li>
                        <li>A dashboard to track a user's transaction history </li>
                        <li>Facebook integration to allow users to share on Facebook the books that they are currently selling on the exchange
                        </li>
                        <li>Duke login so only Duke students can login, preventing anyone from buying and selling books on the site</li>
                        <li>Detailed email notifications when a user buys or sells
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    You need a Duke login to fully explore the site, but you can still search for books without one.

                    <p>Midas is a money management tool I built that catalogs and analyzes e-receipts from users' Gmail in a user-friendly dashboard. Its features are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uses Google sign and OUATH 2.0 authorization for signing in and gaining permission to access a user's email</li>
                        <li>Finds and extracts e-receipts to display them in a sortable table.</li>
                        <li>Extracts data from the e-receipts and graphs the expenditures by days, weeks or months.</li>
                        <li>Allows users to set budgets</li>
                    </ul>
                    You can visit the website and try it out yourself. <b>I won't have access to your email, google credentials, etc. because Midas uses Google sign in which only provides temporary access tokens. I won't get your username and password to your google account.</b>
