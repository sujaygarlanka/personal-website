    <h3 class="md-subhead" flex="70">I am Sujay Garlanka, if you didn't already know from the domain name. I am from Herndon, Virginia and am currently attending Duke University. I will be graduating in 2019 in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Over the past few years, starting in high school, I have been tinkering with electronics and computer science for some projects. I would love for you guys to check out my projects page. All the code is on github. Thanks for visiting my site!</h3>
