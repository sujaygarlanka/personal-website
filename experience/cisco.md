# Cisco Internship (May 2017 - Aug 2017)

Created a proof of concept (POC) for an internal tool to digitize the creation and management of legal documents.

- Implemented a template management system to select the correct form from a series of questions and have the user fill out the dynamic form
- Built in form validations to ensure legal compliance and created dynamic input fields like dynamic tables
- Inserted the contents of that form into a PDF of the appropriate legal document
- Integrated the tool with Docusign for e-signatures and approval
- It can be tracked throughout these stages from draft to pending approval to approved in the tool and previous legal documentation can be easily duplicated and reused for new contracts
