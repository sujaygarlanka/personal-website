# Cisco Internship (May 2017 - Aug 2017)

Created a proof of concept (POC) for an internal tool to digitize the creation and management of legal documents.

- Designed and implemented a template management system thats selects the correct form from a series of questions and dynamically updates based on a user's responses
- Inserted the contents of that form into a PDF of the appropriate legal document
- Implemented review and approval workflows for the documents
- Integrated the tool with DocuSign for e-signatures and approval
